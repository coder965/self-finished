Infinispan's four modes
-----------------------
* *Local*, where entries are stored on the local node only, regardless of whether a cluster has formed. In this mode Infinispan is typically operating as a local cache

* *Invalidation*, where all entries are stored into a cache store (such as a database) only, and invalidated from all nodes. When a node needs the entry it will load it from a cache store. In this mode Infinispan is operating as a distributed cache, backed by a canonical data store such as a database

* *Replication*, where all entries are replicated to all nodes. In this mode Infinispan is typically operating as a data grid or a temporary data store, but doesn't offer an increased heap space

* *Distribution*, where entries are distributed to a subset of the nodes only. In this mode Infinispan is typically operating as a data grid providing an increased heap space

NOTE:Invalidation, Replication and Distribution can all use synchronous or asynchronous communication.

Linux maximum send and recieve buffer size
-------------------------------------------

* check max send buffer size
----
sysctl -a |grep net.core.wmem_max
----

* check max receive buffer size
----
sysctl -a |grep net.core.rmem_max
----

* modify max send and receive buffer size
----
vim /etc/sysctl.conf
----

add the following 2 lines:
----
net.core.wmem_max = 640000
----

----
net.core.rmem_max = 25000000
----

execute the below command for make above configuring take effect:
----
sysctl -p
----
