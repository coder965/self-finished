   It provides a mechanism for communicating with other caches in the cluster.  Using JGroups as an underlying transport.
   It have a simple lifecycle:
     start() - starts the underlying channel based on configuration options injected, and connects the channel
     disconnect() - disconnects the channel</li>
     stop() - stops the dispatcher and releases resources
